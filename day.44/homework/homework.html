<!--Flexbox არის CSS-ის მოდელი, რომელიც გეხმარება ელემენტების დალაგებაში ერთ ხაზზე (row) ან ერთ სვეტში (column) მარტივად, 
და საშუალებას გაძლევს კონტროლიოდე მათი პოზიცია, ზომა და განაწილება კონტეინერის შიგნით.-->

      <h3>Nissan Silvia S15</h3>
      <p>The Nissan Silvia (Japanese: 日産・シルビア, Hepburn: Nissan Shirubia) is the series of small sports cars produced by Nissan. Versions of the Silvia have been marketed as the 200SX or 240SX for export, with some export versions being sold under the Datsun brand.

The Gazelle was the twin-model of Silvia sold in Japan at different dealerships for the S110 and S12 generations; the Gazelle name was also used in Australia for the S12 generation. For the S13 generation in Japan, the Gazelle was replaced with the 180SX, which was a hatchback model of the Silvia with pop-up headlights that was also sold as the 200SX and 240SX for export purposes.</p>

      <h3>Nissan 350z</h3>
      <p>The Nissan 350Z (known as Nissan Fairlady Z (Z33) in Japan) is a two-door, two-seater sports car that was manufactured by Nissan Motor Corporation from 2002 until 2009 and marks the fifth generation of Nissan's Z-car line. The 350Z entered production in 2002 and was sold and marketed as a 2003 model from August 2002. The first year there was only a coupe, as the roadster did not debut until the following year. Initially, the coupe came in Base, Enthusiast, Performance, Touring and Track versions, while the Roadster was limited to Enthusiast and Touring trim levels. The Track trim came with lightweight wheels and Brembo brakes, but its suspension tuning was the same as all other coupes. The Nissan 350Z was succeeded by the 370Z for the 2009 model year, although the roadster was sold alongside the 370Z for 2009.</p>
